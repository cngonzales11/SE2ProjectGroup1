Ah, Good Morning! Hope you slept well.
That was quite the tumble you took yesterday.
Luckily for you, I was able to keep Baldrin from dragging you out of bed before you'd had a chance to rest.
It's almost mid-morning now. You should head outside before Baldrin comes looking for you.


You should probably be headed out to the traning grounds.
I'm sure Baldrin is tired of waiting on you by now.


Hey!
It's about time you woke up!
Come over here so I don't have to yell!

Good. Now, since Hakon seems to think you need rest, we'll be taking it easy today.
There's a training dummy on the other side of the court yard. See about beating some sense into it.

Get to it!
